Social Network App. 

Where to start?  
Recreate blog app w/ Rack + Webpages.   
Add in ORM/SQL.
Authentication.  User registration, login, logout. 
Add in 7 paths.
Add in API.  
Add in HTML/CSS.

Data Model:

Step 1:  User Creation and Authentication.
As a user, I want to see a landing page where users can enter their information/login.
As a site owner, I want to gather the following information and put it into a user object in a database (ORM).   
As a site owner, I want to ensure the email address is unqiue/valid.  Mailgun for email verification? 

User Table:
user_ID | username | password | email         | profile_info
1       | Diana    | iloveyou | me1@gmail.com |*other stuff* 
2       | Hari     | fuzzybear| me2@gmail.com |*other stuff* 
3       | Amanda   | 3Ks!dkfj2| me3@gmail.com |*other stuff*
4       | Bethy    | tedtedte | me4@gmail.com |*other stuff* 
5       | Sid      | craz_indi| me5@gmail.com |*other stuff* 
6       | Sam      | 3Ks!dkfj2| me6@gmail.com |*other stuff*

Note:  Need to implement authorization/user profiles.  Start with public network/blog model.
   
Step 1A: User Profile
As a user, I want to be able to display "About Me" information on my page including a display name.   
As a user, I want to be able to edit "About Me" information.
As a user, I want to be able to delete my profile and/or "About Me" information.  
As a site owner, I want to store the personal information in a user object while displaying it to a user page. 

Step 2:  Status Updates  
As a user, I want to be able to update a status which will be displayed/pushed to other users.
As a user, I want to see others statuses.    
As a user, I want to be able to SCUD my statuses.  
As a site owner, I want to be able to relate the update to the user and display to their individual pages in order of creation.  As a site owner, I want the user_id to determine the webpage on which the status is displayed.
As a site owner, I want to push the status updates to a public newsfeed.  (As a site owner, I will add privacy settings later.)  

Status Table:
status_ID(primary key)| author_ID (foreign)   | status 
1                     | 1                     | *Hello this Diana's first status.*      
2                     | 1                     | *Hello this Diana's second status.*        
3                     | 1                     | *Hello this Diana's third status.* 
4                     | 2                     | *Hello this Hari's first status.*      
5                     | 2                     | *Hello this Hari's second status.*        
6                     | 3                     | *Hello this Amanda's third status.* 
7                     | 3                     | *Hello this Amanda's third status.* 

Step 3: COMMENTING

As a user, I want to be able to comment on others statuses.  
As a site owner, I want to be able to track who comments on what.  
        
Comment Table:
comment_ID (primary key) |author_ID (foreign)    | status_ID (foreign)     | comment_content       
1                        | 2                     | 1                       | *Hari comment on Diana's first status.*  
2                        | 2                     | 1                       | *Hari comment on Diana's first status.*
3                        | 2                     | 3                       | *Hari comment on Diana's third status.* 
 
Step 4: NETWORKING
As a user, I want to be able to pick who I am friends with.
As a site owner, I need to implement viewing/settings to reflect the scope of the network. 

This table will store user requests. Once the connection is accepted, the connection data will be deleted from the table.    
User Relationships: REQUESTS
Accepter_id  | Requester_id 
2            | 1
3            | 1
1            | 4
1            | 5
2            | 4
2            | 5
2            | 6
4            | 3

This table stores all friend connections once the add/accept cycle has been completed.  
User Relationships: ACCEPTS
User1        | User2  
2            | 1
3            | 1
1            | 4
1            | 5
2            | 4
2            | 5
2            | 6
4            | 3

As a site owner, I want this to be a bidirectional relationship. 
As a site owner, I want a friends list to appear on each user profile page as a network graph.
